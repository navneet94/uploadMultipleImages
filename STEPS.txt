STEPS TO UPLOAD MULTIPLE IMAGES
1.CREATE NEW LARAVEL APPLICATION
    -go to the directory where the laravel file is to be created
    -create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel {name of the file}
    -laravel artisan serve
2.Go to welcome.blade.php
    ->create form
        ->action = upload {the route on which request is to be send}
        ->id = upload {name of the id which will be accessed by javascript}
        ->enctype = multipart/form-data {just a requirement}
    ->create input
        ->type=file {for uploading images}
        ->name=file[] {name of the file which will be accessed using routes}
        ->multiple {to access multiple files}
    ->create div for message display
        ->id = message
    ->add javascript using script tag
        ->form = document.getElementById('upload')
        ->request=new XMLHttpRequest() {for enabling ajax request}
        ->form.addEventListener('submit' , function(e)) {to capture the event e}
        ->e.preventDefault() {because we don't want the request to submit to the route, we want to sumit it ourself}
        -> formdata = new FormData(form) {create a new form data}
        ->request.open('post', '/upload') {open a new request and send that request to /upload route}
        ->request.addEventListener("load",transferComplete); {This line means that if the ajax request to the controller gets complete open function transferComplete}
        ->request.send(formdata) {to send the form data to the mentioned route}
        ->outside form.addEventListener declare the function transferComplete
        ->function transferComplete(data)
        ->response = JSON.parse(data.currentTarget.response);
        ->if(response.success)
        ->document.getElementById('message').innerHtml="successfully Uploaded"
    ->add route data in routes.php file
        Route::post(upload, UploadController@upload) {controllerName@FunctionOnController}
    ->make a new controller via cmd
        php artisan make:controller uploadController
    ->Open Upload controller
        ->make the upload function
        ->add Request request as the parameter
        ->print_r($request->all()) {print all the request we are getting on this controller}
        ->$files = $request->file('file') {here 'file' is name of the input given above }
        ->if(!empty($files)){check if files is not empty}
        ->parse through each and every $file using foreach
        ->and put the file in the storage location using Storage::put($file->getClientOriginalName(), file_get_contents($file));
        ->add use Storage;
        ->return JSON request
        -> return \Response::json(array{'success'=>true));
    
3.ALL THE IMAGES ARE BY DEFAULT SAVED TO STORAGE->APP FOLDER
